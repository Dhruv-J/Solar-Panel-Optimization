Solar-Panel-Optimization
========================

This project demonstrates the optimization of solar panel usage based by moving the panel to the optimum angle for highest consumption. While doing so it tilts its x-axis 180 degrees, the incriment being 10 degrees in this case. It does the same with the y-axis, resulting in 324 angle measurements, of which it goes back to the one with the highest voltage measurement.

I researched what other people were doing with this technology, and I found out how they were using photoresistors, not real-time measurement with a solar panel. This technology would be especially useful on cloudy days, when photoresistors would not be able to go the angle with the highest voltage.

If anybody would like to help improve this idea, then you are welcome to do so. You can also submit patches or poll requests. If you try something related to this program feel free to leave a note.
